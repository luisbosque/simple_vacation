This file is for you to describe the simple_vacation application. Typically
you would include information such as the information below:

Description
===========
This application is intended to install in a mail server to auto-respond emails sent to 
a person on vacations. Is based on gnarwl and the old vacation script.

Requirements
============
* Postfix MTA
* OpenLDAP with the ISPEnv2 schema
* Python >= 2.4

Installation and Setup
======================
This script is supposed to work in with any open source MTA (Postfix, qmail, exim, ...).
Right now is only tested in conjunction with Postfix.

First of all you have to copy the entire simple_vacation folder in any path on your server (ex. /usr/local/simple_vacation)

* Postfix

In postfix you have many options to use this script. I use the recipient_bcc_maps configuration parameter that sends a BCC to any email address listed in the table.
In case you want to activate this feature for every target you can also use the always_bcc parameter.
An example of use of recipient_bcc_maps could be the next one (main.cf):
  
    recipient_bcc_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/recipients_maps

With this paraameter, postfix will compare every incoming email against the recipient_maps table.
And example of this table, could be the next one:

    @example.com      vacation@localhost

So, with every email sent to a example.com address (supossely hosted in this server), postfix will create a bcc to the vacation@localhost address. So, here you have two options. One of them is create a vacaction system user and create a .forward file in his home path. The other, is add a postfix transport like this:

    vacation@localhost     vacation:localhost

This can be stored, for example, in a file like /etc/postfix/transport and need to add the next configuration in main.cf:

    transport_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/transport

In case we choose the transport way, we have to add one line in the master.cf postfix configuration file:

    vacation   unix  -       n       n       -       -       pipe
      user=vmail argv=/usr/local/simple_vacation/bin/vacation.py

This tells postfix that every email sent to the vacation transport has to be redirected to the /usr/local/var/lib/vacation/bin/vacation.py program with a pipe.
You can choose any user you want but postfix user that is not allowed. If you chose the vmail user then you have to adjust the simple_vacation permissions in this way:

    chown vmail:root /usr/local/simple_vacation -R
    chmod ug+x /usr/loval/simple/vacation/bin/vacation.py
